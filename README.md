evaluate-infix
==============

Personal project I coded to learn how to traverse binary trees.

How
----
Converts an infix expression to a postfix expression which is then used to created a binary tree. The binary tree is then evaluated to calculate the result of the infix expression

Example inputs
--------------
- 2*(3+4)
- (2+3+52)*54

Usage
------
You can import the project with IntelliJ

Bugs
-----
There are a few bugs still within the code.

Examples

    3+4*5-1

    (1+2)*-1
